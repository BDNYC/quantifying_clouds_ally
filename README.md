# quantifying_clouds_ally

This repo accompanies the research note "Disentangling the Effects of Temperature, Clouds, and Gravity on K I doublet in L dwarfs."

The three notebooks correspond to the plots in the research note, and there are options to view variations of these plots and other plots that were not included in the research note. 

This repo uses [Doublet_Quantifer](https://github.com/BDNYC/Doublet_Quantifier/), which has detailed documentation on how it works and how to install it in its README.

The data used to create the plots come from [The Sonora Substellar Atmosphere Models: Diamondback](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12735103) spectra folder.
